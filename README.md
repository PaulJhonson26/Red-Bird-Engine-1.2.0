# Red-Bird-Engine-1.2.0
 Java Chess Engine

 This is a chess engine I attemped to code to test my Java Knowledge, 
 I'm currently having memory issues with it when running on depth greater than 3. 
 Otherwise it usess a minimax algorithm on a tree to find the sequence of best moves for a given depth
